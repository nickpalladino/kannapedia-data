# Kannapedia Genomic Selection Project

The goal of this project is a learning excercise to see if data available on kannapedia can be used to perform genomic selection for the captured chemotypes with any sort of accuracy.

## Dataset

Kannapedia contains 712 cannabis genotypes performed with StrainSEEK V1 or StrainSEEK V2 from medicinal genomics. 

StrainSEEK V1: 352

StrainSEEK V2: 360

### Genotypes



### Phenotypes

A subset of the samples in Kannnapedia contain the following chemotype data:
* cannabinoids
* terpenes
