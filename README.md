# Kannapedia Genomic Selection Project

The goal of this project is a learning excercise to see if data available on kannapedia can be used to perform genomic selection for the captured chemotypes with any sort of accuracy.

## Dataset

Kannapedia contains 712 cannabis genotypes performed with StrainSEEK V1 or StrainSEEK V2 from medicinal genomics. 

StrainSEEK V1: 352

StrainSEEK V2: 360

### Genotypes

StrainSEEK V2 has 25,000-50,000 SNPs across the genome with increased density on chemotype associated genes. SNPs with higher information content in StrainSEEK V1 were carried over into StrainSEEK V2 for backwards compatibility [[1]](https://www.medicinalgenomics.com/new-data-visualizations-kannapedia/). StrainSEEK V1 SNPs were mapped against the canSat3 reference genome whereas StrainSEEK V2 SNPs were mapped against the Jamaican Lion reference genome. 

### Phenotypes

A subset of the samples in Kannnapedia contain the following chemotype data:
* cannabinoids
* terpenes

### Factors Affecting Genomic Selection

#### Trait Heritability

#### Training Population Size

#### SNP Density

### Other Datasets

* Phylos
* Lynch
* Sawler
